<h1>Variables and Data Types</h1>

<p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values that can be used later in your code. Understanding variables and data types is fundamental to learning JavaScript, as it enables you to store and manipulate information.
</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>
A variable is a container that holds a data value. 
In JavaScript, variables can be declared using the keywords <code>var</code> , <code>let</code> , or <code>const</code> . 
The var keyword was traditionally used to declare variables, but <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are more commonly used today.

When declaring a variable, it's important to give it a meaningful name that describes the data value it holds. 
For example, if you want to store a person's age, you could declare a variable called age.
</p>

<pre><code>let age = 30;</code></pre>


<p>Here, we've declared a variable called age and assigned it the value of 30. 
This means that we can use the age variable to represent the value 30 throughout our code.
</p>


<h2>Data Types</h2>
<p> In JavaScript, there are several different data types that you can store in a variable. Each data type has its own unique properties and behavior.
</p>

<h2>Strings</h2>
<p> Strings are used to represent text values in JavaScript. They can be declared using single or double quotes.

<pre>
    <code>
        let name = "John";
    </code>
</pre>  
</p>

<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p> Numbers are used to represent numeric values in JavaScript. They can be integers (whole numbers) or floating-point numbers (decimals).
<pre>
    <code>
        let age = 30;
        let price = 9.99;
    </code>
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Booleans</h2>
<p> Booleans are used to represent true or false values in JavaScript.
<pre>
    <code>
        let isOnline = true;
    </code>
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Null</h2>
<p>Null is used to represent the absence of any value in JavaScript.
<pre>
    <code>
        let myVar = null;
    </code>
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Undefined</h2>
<p> Undefined is used to represent a variable that has not been assigned a value.
<pre>
    <code>
        let myVar;
        console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
    </code>
</pre>
    
</p>
<h2>Objects</h2>
<p> Objects are used to group related data and functions together in JavaScript.
<pre>
    <code>
    let person = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
        address: {
            street: "123 Main St",
            city: "Anytown",
            state: "CA"
        }
    };
    </code>
</pre>
 
Here, we've declared an object called <code>person</code> that contains several key-value pairs, including a nested object called address.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Variables and data types are essential components of JavaScript that allow you to store and manipulate data values in your code.
By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to write more complex and sophisticated JavaScript applications.</p>
