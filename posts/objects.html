<h1>Objects</h1>

<p> In programming, an object is a collection of related data and functions that can be accessed and manipulated as a single entity. Objects are a fundamental concept in many programming languages, including JavaScript.
</p>  

<p>An object in JavaScript is defined using curly braces {} and can contain one or more key-value pairs. Each key-value pair consists of a property name and its corresponding value, separated by a colon. The property name is a string, while the value can be any data type, including other objects.
</p> 
<p>Here is an example of an object in JavaScript:</p> 

<pre>
    <code>
    let person = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
        address: {
            street: "123 Main St",
            city: "Anytown",
            state: "CA"
        }
    };
    </code>
</pre>

<p>In this example, person is an object that has three properties: name, age, and address. The address property is itself an object that has three properties: street, city, and state.
</p> 
<p>You can access the properties of an object using dot notation or bracket notation. For example:</p> 

<pre>
    <code>
    console.log(person.name); // Output: "John"
    console.log(person["age"]); // Output: 30
    console.log(person.address.city); // Output: "Anytown"
    </code>
</pre>

<p>You can also add or modify properties of an object using dot notation or bracket notation. For example:</p> 

<pre>
    <code>
    person.job = "Software Engineer";
    person["salary"] = 100000;
    console.log(person.job); // Output: "Software Engineer"
    console.log(person.salary); // Output: 100000
    </code>
</pre>

<p>You can also define methods on an object, which are functions that are part of the object. For example:
</p> 
<pre>
    <code>
    let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "Anytown",
        state: "CA"
    },
    sayHello: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
    };
    </code>
</pre>

<pre><code>person.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John"</code></pre>

<p>In this example, sayHello is a method of the person object that logs a greeting to the console using the name property of the object.
</p> 
<p>Objects are a powerful tool in programming that allow you to organize and manipulate data in a structured way. By understanding how to create and work with objects, you can write more flexible and efficient code.</p>
