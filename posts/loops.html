<h1>Loops</h1>
<p>Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. In this blog
    post, we'll introduce you to two types of loops in JavaScript: for loops and while loops.
</p>
<h2>For Loop</h2>
<p> A for loop is a type of loop that repeats a block of code for a specified number of times. Here's an example:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log("The value of i is: " + i);
    }
    </code>
</pre>

<p>In this example, we're using a for loop to repeat the block of code five times. The let i = 0 initializes a counter
    variable i to zero. The i < 5 condition specifies that the loop should continue as long as i is less than 5. The i++
        statement increments i by one after each iteration. </p>
        <p>As the loop runs, we'll see the message "The value of i is:" followed by the value of i in the console.
        </p>
        <h2>While Loop</h2>
        <p> A while loop is another type of loop that repeats a block of code while a condition is true. Here's an
            example:
        </p>
        <pre>
    <code>
    let i = 0;

    while (i < 5) {
        console.log("The value of i is: " + i);
        i++;
    }
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>In this example, we're using a while loop to repeat the block of code while i is less than 5. The i++
            statement increments i by one after each iteration.
        </p>
        <p>As the loop runs, we'll see the message "The value of i is:" followed by the value of i in the console.
        </p>
        <h2>Breaking Out of a Loop</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you may want to break out of a loop early if a certain condition is met. You can use the break
            statement to do this. Here's an example:
        </p>

        <pre>
    <code>
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (i === 3) {
            break;
        }
        console.log("The value of i is: " + i);
    }
    </code>
</pre>

        <p> In this example, we're using a for loop to repeat the block of code five times. However, if i is equal to 3,
            we'll break out of the loop using the break statement. As a result, we'll only see the message "The value of
            i is:" followed by the values of i up to 2.
        </p>
        <h2>Skipping an Iteration</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you may want to skip an iteration of a loop based on a certain condition. You can use the continue
            statement to do this. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
    <code>
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (i === 3) {
            continue;
        }
        console.log("The value of i is: " + i);
    }
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>
            In this example, we're using a for loop to repeat the block of code five times. However, if i is equal to 3,
            we'll skip that iteration using the continue statement. As a result, we'll see the message "The value of i
            is:" followed by the values of i up to 4, but not including 3.
        </p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Loops are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. By
            understanding how to use for loops and while loops, as well as the break and continue statements, you'll be
            able to write more efficient and dynamic code
            by using loops, you can write more efficient and dynamic code because you can repeat a block of code without
            having to write it out multiple times. This can save you time and effort when coding.
        </p>

        <p>Loops can also be used with arrays and other data structures to iterate through them and perform a certain
            action on each element. This allows you to perform the same operation on multiple elements without having to
            write the code for each one separately.
        </p>
        <p>Another advantage of loops is that they allow you to perform conditional logic based on certain conditions.
            For example, you can use a loop to iterate through a list of numbers and only perform an action on the ones
            that meet a certain criteria.
        </p>

        <p>By using loops effectively, you can make your code more flexible and adaptable to different situations. For
            example, if you need to perform a certain action a variable number of times, you can use a loop with a
            variable counter to achieve this.
        </p>

        <p>In addition, loops can be nested, allowing you to perform more complex operations on your data structures.
            For example, you can use a nested loop to compare elements in two different arrays and perform an action
            based on their relationship to each other.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, loops are a fundamental tool in programming that allow you to repeat code, iterate through data
            structures, and perform conditional logic. By mastering loops, you can write more efficient and dynamic code
            that can be adapted to a variety of situations.
