    <h1>Preparing your Environment</h1>
    <p>While traditionally JavaScript coding has been done on desktop or laptop computers, it is now possible to set up
        a JavaScript coding environment on your phone.
        In this blog post, we'll go over the steps you can take to prepare a JavaScript coding environment on your
        Android phone.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Choose a Code Editor App</h2>
    <p>The first step in setting up a JavaScript coding environment on your phone is to choose a code editor app.
        There are plenty options to choose on, lets narrow down to <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.foxdebug.acode/">Acode</a>  which is found on <a href="https://f-droid.org/">Fdroid</a> , it works well
        offline.
        Another editor on will be Vim from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/">Termux</a> 
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Install Termux</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/">Termux</a>: An Android app that allows you to run a full Linux environment on your device, including a JavaScript
        runtime.
        With Termux we can run node.js, vim editor, git for version control, development server and many more.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Start Coding!</h2>
    <p>Once you have your code editor, JavaScript runtime, and development server set up, you're ready to start coding!
        You can now write JavaScript code directly on your phone and test it on a local development server.
        While coding on a phone can be challenging due to the smaller screen size and lack of a physical keyboard, it
        can be a convenient way to work on your JavaScript projects while on-the-go.
        It also helps learning without investing too much resources in the beginning.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In this blog post, we've gone over the steps you can take to prepare a JavaScript coding environment on your phone. 
        While it may take some time to set up, having a mobile coding environment can be a great way to work on your JavaScript projects wherever you are.
