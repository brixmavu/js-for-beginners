    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was first released in 1995. It is primarily
        used
        for creating interactive and dynamic websites. Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript does not need to
        be
        compiled, making it a fast and efficient tool for web developers. JavaScript is also a client-side language,
        meaning
        it is executed in the user's browser rather than on the server.
